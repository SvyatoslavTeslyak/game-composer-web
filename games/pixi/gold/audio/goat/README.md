Several takes per sound (`_0`, `_1`, …; listed in `assets/audio/sounds.json`); one is picked at random with a little pitch variation.
Post-processing: MP3 → 44.1 kHz mono 16-bit WAV (afconvert), leading/trailing silence
trimmed at −40 dB, 4 ms fade-in, 60 ms fade-out, peak normalized to −1 dBFS, length capped.

No goat voice is used anywhere in the game. Panel/UI sounds (tap, toggle, refill, HUD coins, win sting) are not here; they come from the UI kit.
