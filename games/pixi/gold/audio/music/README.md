# Background theme

`theme.wav` is this game's own loop: warm banjo and soft accordion with light woodblock percussion.

Processing: decoded to mono 44.1 kHz, the last 2 s cross-faded back over the
opening so the seam is inaudible (28.0 s), levelled to -18 dB RMS. The build
converts it to Opus and AAC; the game plays it as a loop.

It plays on its own source, so it never steals a voice from an effect, and
starts and stops with the Music setting. the `music` event in `assets/audio/sounds.json` sets the level; retune it in Crash Composer → Sound Studio.
