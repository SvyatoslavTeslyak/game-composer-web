# Background theme

`theme.wav` is this game's own loop: soft acoustic guitar and mellow flute over slow warm pads.

Processing: decoded to mono 44.1 kHz, the last 2 s cross-faded back over the
opening so the seam is inaudible (28.0 s), levelled to -18 dB RMS. The build
converts it to Opus and AAC like every other sound; the game loops it seamlessly
through Web Audio.

It plays through its own gain node, so it never steals a voice from an effect,
and starts and stops with the Music setting. The `music` event in `assets/audio/sounds.json` sets the level; retune it in Crash Composer → Sound Studio.
